React can not Render Object! Sounds Confusing, Right?

Long Story Short: (TL; DR)
Browsers primarily understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you pass something (except object) into props, JSX automatically converts it into a renderable format and updates the virtual DOM (because it's faster than direct DOM updates). But when you try to pass a raw object directly into JSX, React gets confused and can’t interpret it properly — it's like double objects for React.

So, what is the solution? 
➡️ Convert the object into a string using JSON.stringify(). OR
➡️ Treat the object as a nested object by accessing its properties.

Example:

const Person = {myName: "Emran Khan"}
return (
 <main>
 {JSON.stringify(Person)}
 <br />
 {Person.myName}
 </main>
)
